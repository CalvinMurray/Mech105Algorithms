This algorithm contains a function that will compute the COmposite 1/3 Simpson's Rule in order to approximate the integral of a function.
If the function has uneven steps, the last step of the function will be computed by a Trapezoidal Rule and added with the Composite Simpson's Rule.
However, if the function has even steps, just the Composite Simpson's Rule will be applied.
In order for the function to work, you must input two vectors of the x and y values. The output will be a single value, the integral of the function.
