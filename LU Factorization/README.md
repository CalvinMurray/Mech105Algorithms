This algorithm contains a function that determines the the L, U, and P matrices of an input matrix by using LU decompisition.
The input is a matrix of the coeficients of a system of equations. The outputs are the L, U and P matrices. The L matrix is the lower triangular matrix of the Gauss Elimination.
The U matrix is the upper triangular matrix and the P matrix is the matrix to show the pivoting used in the Gauss Elimination.
